This repository contains an experimental implementation of generic functions
for [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org). The idea is to hack some code to
get an idea of what the right design for generics in Racket should look like.

Note: the latest pre-release version of Racket has a comprehensive implementation
of generics (documented [here](http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/reference/struct-generics.html)).
The implementation was originally made by Eli Barzilay and Jay McCarthy (and later
modified by myself and Vincent St-Amour). Please look there if you are interested in
generics for Racket.
